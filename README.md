# Coinflip_Randomness_Project
Overarching question: Is human intuition of randomness correlated with cognitive complexity? 

Phase 1: 
I conducted a survey in which I asked participants to imagine flipping a coin 12 times and give out the series of heads and tails. I also asked them seven questions from the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT-7) which is a classic behavioral/cognitive science test widely used as a measure of aptitude. The survey was made on Google Forms, and the data was stored in Google Sheets. 
The data analysis plan involves the following: 
(i) Figuring out how well did each participant simulate the coinflip
(ii) How well did they do in the CRT? 
(iii) Is there any correlation between their 'intuition' of randomness exhibited by their simulation of coinflips and their cognitive complexity exhibited by their performance in the CRT-7? 

For (i), I need to simulate a large number of coinflips on R/python and extract features of the non-biased coinflips - basically, how the heads and tails are distributed in computer-generated flips? We may look into features such as the counts of heads (or tails), the streaks of length (1, 2 and 3), and standard deviation of the positions of streaks, and the occurence of the longest streaks. 
For (ii), I need to aggregate their scores in the seven questions to come up with their overall CRT score. 
For (iii), I just need to carry out the correlation coefficient. 

Being the very first project in this new GitHub account, I aim to accomplish the following through this project: 
(a) Refresh and showcase my coding skills. I plan to do it in R, which I call my native tongue, and then in python. 
(b) lay foundation for the next phase: creating a Shiny App dashboard to continue collecting data and turning it into a publication-worthy project. I plan to write an APA-format paper on R Markdown.
